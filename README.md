Hussein's Blackjack

This is a blackjack emulator in Windows DOS application. I wrote for a final project in a computer science class while in high school.

RULES FOR BLACKJACK (21)

=========

1.  This game will be played with a standard straight deck of 52 cards. Each card has a suit (heart, diamond, club, or spade) and a rank (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10, Jack, Queen, or King). The value of a card is 1 for an Ace; ranks 2-10 have a value equal to their rank, and the Jack, Queen, and King have a value of 10.

2. This game will be played with seven players, each against the dealer.

3. The game begins by dealing two cards to each of the players and the dealer. One of the dealer cards is not exposed.

4. Each player in turn can ask for many additional cards as s/he wishes, one at a time. If a player's total exceeds 21, that player automatically loses to the dealer and is no longer in that game.

5. After each player has received all their cards, the dealer must take additional cards until the dealer's total is at least 17, after which he can take no more cards.

6. If the dealer has a total > 21, all remaining players win. Otherwise, each player wins if has a greater total than the dealer, or the dealer wins if he has a total greater than the player. Nobody wins on a tie.
